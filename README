A bunch of miscellaneous utilities/fun programs I've written over the years.
All of these are for unix-like systems.

chroot-break.c - Used to break out of a chroot that you have root in
kirby.c - Shows a dancing ASCII Kirby
sizeof.c - Print the size of various types on the system

These are all distributed under the terms of the WTFPL (see COPYING).
